                'Despite many advances in our industry, the majority of '
                'business payments are still made with outdated and inferior '
                'payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a '
                'business world where every purchase is controlled, every '
                'payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is '
                'well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will '
                'require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with '
                'more time for what matters most: activities that grow their '
                'businesses.\n'
                ' \n'
                'Our Mission\n'
                ' \n'
                'FLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way '
                'to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks '
                'and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those '
                'methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create '
                'and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating '
                'constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting '
                'merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR.\n'
                ' \n'
                'Our Strategy\n'
                ' \n'
                'FLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple '
                'three-prong strategy for growing our business:\n'
                ' \n'
                ' More Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in '
                'sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer '
                'acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and '
                'headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and '
                'other tools, and launch new distribution channels both '
                'internally and through partners such as ERP software '
                'providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow '
                'our customer base inorganically through acquisitions. \n'
                ' More Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer '
                'relationships and capture greater share of their business '
                'payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various '
                '“beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an '
                'existing payment product without degrading the core value '
                'proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can '
                '“buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and '
                'reporting which attracted the customer to our product to '
                'begin with. For example: \n'
                ' Our Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow '
                'non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing '
                'a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, '
                'so they can finish the paint job. \n'
                ' Our Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to '
                'make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and '
                'fast-food. \n'
                ' \n'
                'For our customers, these product extensions reduce payment '
                'friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For '
                'FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of '
                'wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ '
                'appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer '
                'segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new '
                'product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction '
                'with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base.\n'
                ' \n'
                ' More Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry '
                'opportunities in major international markets, which we intend '
                'to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships. \n'
                ' \n'
